    </div>
  );
}
```

### Customizing Your Experiences

Edit the `experiences` array in `BakingRoadmap.jsx`:

```jsx
const experiences = [
  {
    title: "Your Role Title",
    icon: "🧁", // Any emoji or icon
    responsibilities: [
      "Responsibility 1",
      "Responsibility 2",
      "Responsibility 3"
    ],
    achievements: [
      "Achievement 1",
      "Achievement 2",
      "Achievement 3"
    ],
    duration: "2 years",
    difficulty: "Intermediate" // Beginner, Intermediate, Advanced, Expert
  },
  // Add more experiences...
];
```

## 📱 Mobile Experience

- **Touch Interaction**: Tap baking tools to view recipe cards
- **Bottom Cards**: Recipe cards slide up from bottom on mobile
- **Close Button**: Easy-to-tap close button for recipe cards
- **Responsive Layout**: Optimized for all screen sizes

## 🎯 3D Elements

The component uses Three.js with React Three Fiber for:
- **Floating Icons**: Each baking tool gently floats and rotates
- **Hover Effects**: Icons scale up and show sparkles on interaction
- **Lighting**: Ambient and directional lighting for depth
- **Materials**: Realistic materials and colors for each tool

## 🎨 Customization Options

### Colors
Modify the CSS variables in `BakingRoadmap.css`:

```css
.baking-roadmap {
  background: linear-gradient(135deg, #your-color 0%, #your-color 50%, #your-color 100%);
}

.recipe-card {
  background: linear-gradient(135deg, #your-color 0%, #your-color 100%);
}
```

### 3D Icons
Add new baking tool icons by creating new components in `BakingRoadmap.jsx`:

```jsx
function NewBakingIcon({ position, scale = 1, onClick, isHovered }) {
  return (
    <Float speed={1.5} rotationIntensity={0.5} floatIntensity={0.5}>
      <group position={position} scale={scale} onClick={onClick}>
        {/* Your 3D geometry here */}
        {isHovered && <Sparkles count={20} scale={0.5} size={2} speed={0.3} />}
      </group>
    </Float>
  );
}
```

### Animations
Customize animation speeds and effects:

```css
@keyframes glow {
  from { text-shadow: 0 0 20px rgba(255, 182, 193, 0.3); }
  to { text-shadow: 0 0 30px rgba(255, 182, 193, 0.6); }
}
```
